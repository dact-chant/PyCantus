PyCantus documentation
======================

PyCantus is envisioned as a Python API to the Cantus family of databases that makes it easy to use this data for 
computational processing. Primarily we intend this to be used for research in digital chant scholarship, 
but of course it can be used to build chant-centric apps, new websites, 
extract data for comparative studies across different repertoires, study liturgy, etc.
